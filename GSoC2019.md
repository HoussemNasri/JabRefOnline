# Ideas for Google Summer of Code 2019

In academia, knowledge has to be manged.
The tool [JabRef](http://www.jabref.org/) focusses on managing related work.
It has a large user base and is the most prominent open source reference manager.
Currently, the tool is mainly used to manage [BibTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) files, which are used in [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) documents.
With this GSoC project, the functionality of JabRef should be enhanced so that there is a greater user experience.

This page lists a number of ideas for potential Google Summer of Code 2019 projects.
Hereafter we list, in no particular order, some proposals for projects to be carried out by the students participating in GSoC 2019. This is by no means a closed list, so the students can feel free to propose alternative activities related to the project.
In cooperation with the developers and the community, students will get feedback and guidance to improve the proposal until submission.

<!--
> Also check out Research/Ideas (project ideas related to research or academia), Top Ten Tasks (some prominent development tasks in the OSM ecosystem), and existing bugs for more problems to solve.
-->

Since 3 years, the JabRef developers aim for increasing the code quality of JabRef.
Having pull requests reviewed by at least two other developers, the feedback on the code is of high quality.
The benefit for the contributor is that his Java coding skills are enhanced:
Not only the features are evaluated, but also the architecture of the code and the code style.
After going through that feedback, all contributors said that they learned much during contributing to JabRef.

Potential students applicants are encouraged to discuss their ideas on our [Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/JabRef/jabref).

## PDF

* *Description:* JabRef supports the attachment of PDF documents to bibtex entries. These PDF documents usually are the full text (e.g. the article) that are associated with the bibliographic entry. Currently, in JabRef only entries can be searched. The associated PDF document cannot be searched.
* *Skills required:* Java
* *Expected outcome:*
  A (combined) search interface which presents search results from attached PDF documents.
* *Possible mentors:* [Tobias Dietz](https://github.com/tobiasdiez)

## LaTeX Integration

* *Description:*
  Currently JabRef is focused on bibliographic management functionalities. However, a deeper integration with the actual document text would be beneficial. For example, information about what references are used in which text document, how often and at which  position can provide the authors with additional tools to improve theirs works.
* *Skills required:* Java
* *Expected outcome:*
  Ability to trace bibliograhic entries in (LaTex) text documents. Information on the whereabouts, the quantity of usages, position in the text, and jump to file functionality.
* *Possible mentors:* [Tobias Dietz](https://github.com/tobiasdiez)

## Microsoft Word Integration

* *Description:*
  Implement a direct bibliography integration with Microsoft Word. JabRef has a deep integration with BibTeX and biblatex but can equally be valuable for authors that prefer writing in Microsoft Word. Currently, this integration is lacking and would be highly beneficial as an Open Source alternative to existing software such as Mendeley.

* *Skills required:* Java, .NET

* *Expected outcome:*
  Basic integration of bibliographic functionalities such as inserting, editing, and synching bibliographic entries between Word and JabRef.
* *Possible mentors:* [Tobias Dietz](https://github.com/tobiasdiez)

## ShareLaTeX Integration with a great UX

* *Description*: [ShareLaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShareLaTeX) is an open source online LaTeX editor. It greatly supports researches in collaboratively writing academic papers. ShareLaTeX, however, misses collaboratively working on bibliographic entries. This is where JabRef jumps in: JabRef already [supports collaboratively working using a PostgreSQL database](http://help.jabref.org/en/SQLDatabase), where updates are instantly propagated. Currently, there is no such support or ShareLaTeX. When other users are online, their changes should transparently be integrated in the current database. An interruption should only occur when the same entry is modified.
* *Skills required:* Java
* *Expeted outcome:* JabRef should be able to connect to a ShareLaTeX project and update biblioraphy data there. Moreover, a local copy of the bibliography file has to kept updated.
* *Possible mentors:* [Oliver Kopp](https://github.com/koppor), [Christoph](https://github.com/Siedlerchr)
