# Ideas for Google Summer of Code 2019

This page lists a number of ideas for potential Google Summer of Code 2019 projects.
Hereafter we list, in no particular order, some proposals for projects to be carried out by the students participating in GSoC 2019. This is by no means a closed list, so the students can feel free to propose alternative activities related to the project.
In cooperation with the developers and the community, students will get feedback and guidance to improve the proposal until submission.

> Also check out Research/Ideas (project ideas related to research or academia), Top Ten Tasks (some prominent development tasks in the OSM ecosystem), and existing bugs for more problems to solve. 
Potential students applicants are encouraged to discuss their ideas on the forum mailing list.

## LaTeX Integration ##
* Description:*
Currently JabRef is focused on bibliographic management functionalities. However, a deeper integration with the actual document text would be beneficial. For example, information about what references are used in which text document, how often and at which  position can provide the authors with additional tools to improve theirs works.

* Skills required:* Java

* Expected outcome:*
Ability to trace bibliograhic entries in (LaTex) text documents. Information on the whereabouts, the quantity of usages, position in the text, and jump to file functionality.

* Possible mentors:*


## Microsoft Word Integration ##
* Description:*
Implement a direct bibliography integration with Microsoft Word. JabRef has a deep integration with BibTeX and biblatex but can equally be valuable for authors that prefer writing in Microsoft Word. Currently, this integration is lacking and would be highly beneficial as an Open Source alternative to existing software such as Mendeley.

* Skills required:* Java, .NET

* Expected outcome:*
Basic integration of bibliographic functionalities such as inserting, editing, and synching bibliographic entries between Word and JabRef.

* Possible mentors:*
