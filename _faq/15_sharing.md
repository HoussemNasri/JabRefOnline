# Sharing

## Q: How does JabRef support me in sharing my libraries?

A: JabRef automatically recognizes a change in the `bib` file on disk and notifies the user of it.
This is cool for network drives.
If you use version control, we recommend to right click on the tab of the database, click on "database properties", and define a sort order on the file.
We recommend, year, author, title.
In addition, we have [many open issues dealing with collaboration](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/FeatureRequests-Sorted#allow-me-to-work-with-others-please).
