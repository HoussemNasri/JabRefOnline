If you want to be sure to work on something, the core developers currently do not handle, check the [issues tagged with asking-for-a-pull-request](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/labels/asking-for-a-pull-request).
See our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed information and further links.

## Q: I would like to help translating JabRef to another language.
How do I get started?

A: We encourage you to read [Translating JabRef](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/Translating-JabRef).

## Q: I want send a patch.
Where can I do that?

A: We really prefer the pull request approach of GitHub.
In case you want to contribute something, but git seems to be too hard for you, please get in touch with the developers to work out other ways of contributing.
