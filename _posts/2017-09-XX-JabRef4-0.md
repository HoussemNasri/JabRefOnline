Finally, we are proud to announce JabRef 4.0!
This major release comes almost two years after JabRef 3.0 and more than half a year after the latest stable release JabRef 3.8.2.
Back in October 2003, when Morten Alver made the [first commit](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/commit/65e697572b0715f282f8545dd59a1cf2ea129b60) (he used Subversion back then) on he surely didn't imagine that this project would grow to such popularity and stand the test of time even **14 years** later.

During the time we constantly improved not only the codebase, but most important the user experience and fixed plenty of bugs and implemented new features.
We want to take this post as an opportunity to **thank** all developers, contributors, translators, and users for the work and feedback!


The sheer age of this piece of software required to do some technological renovations, which is our largest challenge these days: Transitioning the user interface to [JavaFX](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/javafx-overview-2158620.html).
The goal is to provide a modern, platform independent User Interface which is also suited for high dpi screens.
As the new technology is a major step, we change the user interface part by part, so you still might encounter some bugs from he interplay with the old and new technology.
