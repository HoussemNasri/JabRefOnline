We are proud to announce the release of version 5.7 of our favorite citation manager JabRef. Several bugs have been fixed and some improvements were made to the ui:

## Notable Changes and New Features

Citations can now be looked up in the [Biodiversity Heritage Library}(https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/) and Citavi backup files imported. A new filter to the Unlinked Files Search has been introduced to exclude files according to a .gitignore file in the search directory. Entries can be moved to another library by dragging and dropping them to the tab in the table view and native support for apa legal entry types has been introduced.

The "Automatic Field Editor" dialog was refurbished by our GSoC mentee [@HoussemNasri](https://github.com/HoussemNasri). There may be some issues left, feel free to report them in our issue tracker. Also there have been several issues fixed about writing BibTeX data into a PDF file and handling the charset of the BibTex files.

As we updated the full text search engine to Lucene 9.2, JabRef will recreate the search index in the background on start. Be aware that switching back and forth will make JabRef repeat this process every time and this will take a long time for huge databases.

For a complete list of all our changes, take a look at the [Changelog](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

**You can get JabRef as free software from [FOSShub](https://www.fosshub.com/JabRef.html).**

In case you notice any bugs or problems, please check our [bug tracker](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues) and consider submitting a new bug report if nobody else has been reporting the failure before.

## Special Thanks

The [JabRef Maintainers](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/MAINTAINERS) would like to give special thanks to all new and old contributors. We are delighted to see contributors opening pull requests and making translations or simply answering questions in our [support forum](https://discourse.jabref.org/).
As we all work on JabRef in our free time, we feel honored that people share our enthusiasm for free software and work together to make research easier.

A big thanks also to all our donators! Especially we would like to thank our GSoC mentee @HoussemNasri for his extensive work on JabRef and Google for providing the scholarship for his project in GSoC. We expect to include the result of his efforts to improve the three-way-merge dialog in the next release.

We also want to thank all universities [including JabRef in their academic teaching](https://devdocs.jabref.org/teaching).

Finally, we want to thank all the users who are constantly testing the latest snapshots and giving feedback!

The JabRef Maintainers wish everyone to find themselves filled with inner peace and joy exploring the vast world of possiblities that literature management brings to you!
