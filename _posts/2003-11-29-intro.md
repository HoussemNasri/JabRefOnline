JabRef is an open source bibliography reference manager.
The native file format used by JabRef is BibTeX, the standard LaTeX bibliography format.
JabRef runs on the [Java VM](http://www.java.com/) (version 1.8 or newer), and works equally well on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

BibTeX is an application and a bibliography file format written by Oren Patashnik and Leslie Lamport for the LaTeX document preparation system.
General information can be found on the [CTAN BibTeX package information page](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/bibtex).
JabRef also supports [BibLaTeX](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex).

Bibliographies generated by LaTeX and BibTeX from a BibTeX file can be formatted to suit any reference list specifications through the use of different BibTeX and BibLaTeX style files.
