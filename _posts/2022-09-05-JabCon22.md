From Friday, September 2 to Monday, September 5, 2022 the annual [JabCon](https://jabcon.jabref.org/) took place in Stuttgart, Germany, where the majority of the JabRef maintainers and some members of our non-profit organization JabRef e.V. met in person and worked together to improve JabRef and discuss the roadmap for future releases.
We are happy to announce that JabRef e.V. now has 25 members who support JabRef's development in various ways and keep us motivated.

This year we focused on smaller improvements, [code quality](https://devdocs.jabref.org/code-howtos/code-quality.html) and bug fixes.
Especially we focused on fixes and improvements regarding handling of linked files.
The Systematic Literature Review feature also got polished and we improved the usability.
In addition, we also focused on one larger feature: the conversion of our old search to the new lucence search which will be part of the upcoming version 6 release in the near future.
While code quality does not always have a visible impact on the user, it is an important aspect to improve the maintanability of JabRef.
