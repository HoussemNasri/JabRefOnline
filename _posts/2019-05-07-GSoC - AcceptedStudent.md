Great news! In the last post we announced that JabRef got accepted as an open source organization for this year's [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). 
and now we are happy to tell that we have accepted a student, David Mendez, who will be improving JabRef this summer.

Until August 19, 2019 he will be working on the project "Bidirectional Integration — Paper Writing — LaTeX and JabRef 5.0".
We are looking forward to working with him. He wil be mentored throughout the project by three of our developers.

We nonetheless would thank all other students as well who applied for GSoC and chose JabRef as organization they wanted to work with.
This year is the first time JabRef is participating in GSoC and we were overwhelmed by the interest in JabRef.

Of course, all other interested persons are invited as well to contribute!

Stay tuned for further updates!
