We are proud to announce the release of the next milestone of JabRef, this time JabRef 5.4, just in time for the holidays!
It's been roughly half a year since the previous release of 5.3, and we are happy to announce that despite the still ongoging Covid-19 waves we were all fortunately able to continue working on JabRef.

## Notable Changes and New Features

Thanks to this year's Google Summer of Code, JabRef now as a PDF-fulltext search and improved metadata support. Search across libraries and in your linked pdf files.
Search results across several libraries can now also be shown again in a new window. It's also possible to keep the search string when switching between libraries.
Another major improvement is the metadata extraction and writing for PDFs. When generating an entry from a PDF, JabRef now checks different sources and provides an improved merge dialog to combine the extracted metadata.

Further work focused on improving the user experience in the GUI. For example, we added an icon picker to the Groups dialog to easily search for a nice group icon.
We also added the possibilty to search all avaiable citation styles together with a sample preview.

Despite this new features, we also fixed many bugs. Some of them were related to import/export and the handling of linked files.
For a complete list of all our changes, take a look at the [Changelog](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) since our last official release!
