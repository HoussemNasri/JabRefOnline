After more than four months of hard work and following our work on the JabCon, we are proud to release JabRef 4.2.

We worked to fix a lot of freezes and performance issues, for example when searching or opening the entry editor.
Some other performance improvements are related to JournalAbbrevations.

Of course, we also implemented some cool new features, for example the PDF-XMP Import/Export in DublinCore format.
The DublinCore format is now the only metadata format which JabRef supports in PDFs. Our previous developed custom format was dropped in favor of the DublinCore format.

Addtionally, based on a feature request in our forum, JabRef is now able to import files in Endnote-XML format.
Furthermore, we improved the export of the `address`  and `location` field to the corresponding MS-Office XML fields.
If the address field does not contain a comma, it is treated as single value and exported to the field city. [#1750, comment](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/1750#issuecomment-357539167) For more details refer to the [field mapping help page](http://help.jabref.org/en/MsOfficeBibFieldMapping)

We fixed and extended the RIS import functionality to cover more fields.

To avoid confusion, we renamed the `Review`-Tab in the entry editor in the `Comments`-Tab. Existing entries in one of the fields will be merged.

Despite fixing some existing fetchers, for example the IEEE fetcher now uses `https`, we implemented support for the [oaDOI](https://oadoi.org/) fetcher.
JabRef is now able ow able to provide fulltexts for more than 90 million open-access articles.

Unfortunately, JabRef binaries are not digitally signed any more.
We are working in a fix, but this will take some weeks to months. We are in the process of obtaining a new Certifcate from Comodo.
In the meantime, please check the [installations instructions](https://help.jabref.org/en/#faq) for your Operating System (especially [MacOs](https://help.jabref.org/en/FAQosx)), in case JabRef cannot be started.
