After more than two months of hard work, we are proud to release JabRef 4.1.
While 4.0 was imperfect, we needed to release it anyways since more and more features of the previous version 3.8.2 stopped working.
Since [then](https://blog.jabref.org/2017/10/04/JabRef4-0/) we primarily focused on performance and memory issues, but were also able to to add new features.
Furthermore, the release also attracted some new contributors from the community and we are proud to see 12 new contributors since the last release.
We are thankful for that and enjoy seeing the JabRef community growing.

Unfortunately, JabRef binaries are not digitally signed any more. We are working in a fix, but this will take some weeks to months.
Until now, we used a certificate from Certum.
Certum (by [@asseco](https://twitter.com/assecods)) used to offer Open Source Code Signing with a file-based certificate file. This is not possible any more:
[One needs a code signing hardware](https://en.sklep.certum.pl/data-safety/code-signing-certificates/open-source-code-signing-933.html).
Other certificate providers have higher burdens to obtain a certificate.

The main change is an improve of the performance during startup and when rendering [CSL styles](http://citationstyles.org/) preview.



## Changed

- We now set the `WM_CLASS` of the UI to org-jabref-JabRefMain to allow certain Unix window managers to properly identify its windows
- We improved the way metadata is updated in remote databases. [#3235](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3235)


## Bug Fixes

- We fixed an issue where dropping a pdf on the entry table and renaming it triggered an exception. [#3490](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3490)
- We fixed an issue where automatically found files where not added with a relative paths when the bib file is in the same directory as the files. [#3476](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3476)
- We no longer allow to add a field multiple times in customized entry types and thereby fix an issue in the entry editor that resulted from having a field multiple times. [#3046](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3046)
 - We fixed an issue where editing in the source tab would override content of other entries. [#3352](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/3352#issue-268580818)
- We fixed an issue where timestamps were not updated for changed entries. [#2810](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/2810)
