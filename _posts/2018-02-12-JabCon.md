Last week the annual [JabCon](https://jabcon.jabref.org/) took place in Dresden, Germany, where the majority of the JabRef developers in person and worked together to improve JabRef and discuss the roadmap for future releases.
The conference is intended for users and developers of JabRef. 
The goal is to strengthen the network between users, between users and developers, and between the developers.

As some of you might have already seen, we implemented some new features, fixed and closed a lot of issues. 
We could successfully reduce the number of open issues to 128 from previous over 190 open issues.
We are currently working on a new version containing the results of our hacking sessions.

Our future plans include the migration to JavaFX of some core components. Especially the [maintable](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/3621) and the [MainFrame](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/3684)

We would like to thank the organizers [@koppor], [@stefan-kolb], [@lenhard] and [SAP SE Dresden](https://zeus2018.org/venue/), Dresden, Germany for providing us with an on site location for the conference
Furthermore we would like to thank our [donators](https://donations.jabref.org) who made it possible for many JabRef developers to attend the conference and to support our work.
If you like to donate money on a regularly basis, you can now support us on [Liberapay(https://liberapay.com/JabRef)
