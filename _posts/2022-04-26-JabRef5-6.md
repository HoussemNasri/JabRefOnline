We are proud to announce the release of the next milestone of JabRef, this time JabRef 5.6. As always, this release comes with several bug fixes and also a couple of new features.

## Notable Changes and New Features

This release comes with several new fetchers for the websearch, most notable [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/) and [SemanticScholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) as well as the [Directory of Open Access Books](https://doabooks.org/). Next to bibliographic metadata, if avaiable and acessible, fulltext PDFs can also be downloaded for these new fetchers.

We replaced the OttoBib fetcher by a OpenLibrary fetcher and ISBNs are now fetched from [OpenLibrary](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books).

We also enabled the user to customize the API Key for some fetchers, namely Springer, ScienceDirect, IEEEXplore and SAO/NASA ADS. This may sound very technical, but is something very useful for users that have full and priviledged access to certain web-portals/databases, but were not able to have this priviledged access from within JabRef. Custom API keys can now be added in the preferences under "Options > Preferences > Import and Export".

Another notable change for users (with large databases) is the upgrade to Lucene 9.1 for the fulltext search. The now created search index cannot be read from older versions of JabRef anylonger, thus JabRef will recreate the index in a new folder for new files and this will take a long time for a huge library. Switching back and forth JabRef versions and meanwhile adding PDFs also requires rebuilding the index now and then. Having realized indexing can take a long time for huge libraries, a preference was added that allows to disable the indexing.

JabRef also went another few steps towards Unicode support: When exporting entries, the encoding is now always UTF-8; When embedding BibTeX data into a PDF, the encoding is always UTF-8; and we removed the option to configure the default encoding: The default encoding is now hard-coded to the modern UTF-8 encoding.

Of course, we also fixed many other bugs and some external dependencies were updated under the hood. As a result, there have been reports JabRef feels a tick faster and for most tasks is using a little less Random Access Memory (RAM) as compared to version 5.5 and we are very happy about that! (From personal experience: writing XMP metadata to linked PDFs will require lots of RAM, though!).

For a complete list of all our changes, take a look at the [Changelog](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) since our last official release!
