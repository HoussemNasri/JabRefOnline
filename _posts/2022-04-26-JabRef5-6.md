We are proud to announce the release of the next milestone of JabRef, this time JabRef 5.6. As always, this release comes with several bug fixes and also a couple of new features.

## Notable Changes and New Features

This release comes with several new fetchers, most notable [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/) and [SemanticScholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) as well as the [Directory of Open Access Books](https://doabooks.org/). If avaiable and acessible, fulltext PDFs are also downloaded for these new fetchers.
Additionally to these, we also fixed many bugs.
For a complete list of all our changes, take a look at the [Changelog](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) since our last official release!
