Great news! JabRef got accepted as open source organization for this year's [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
The GSoC is an annual program with the goal to bring more student developers into open source development.
Students work three months on a project for an open source organization and are mentored by members of the project.

Until April 9, 2019 students can apply for participation in the GSoC and afterwards the organizations will review the applications.
We are looking forward to the event and hope that we can attract some students for improving JabRef further.

> Project ideas are collected at <http://www.jabref.org/GSoC2019.html>.

In the meantime we are also working hard on finishing the conversion to the new GUI technology JavaFX with the goal to streamline the user experience when using JabRef.
The majority of dialogs is already converted.

Stay tuned for further updates!
