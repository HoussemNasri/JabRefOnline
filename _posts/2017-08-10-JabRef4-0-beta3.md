The transition to JavaFX is reaching a milestone where most of the entry editor is already migrated.
This beta-3 release should encourage users to test the new interface of the entry editor, as we feel that it can be released soon.

Since the last [beta-2 release](http://blog.jabref.org/2017/07/19/JabRef4-0-beta2) we focused mainly on the interplay of the new entry editor with the rest of JabRef, especially the main table.
There we fixed several issues concerning keyboard shortcuts, special actions like UNDO-REDO and the overall stability of the program.

Most problems should be resolved by now, and we need your [feedback](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/new) for being confident that we can release JabRef 4.0.
