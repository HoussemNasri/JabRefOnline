Since the release of Version 4.3.1 we have been continously working on fixing and converting the old GUI technology to the new one, JavaFX. 
One of the biggest new features is the redesign of the maintable with JavaFX. Other dialogs have been converted as well or are currently in the process of beeing converted.

TODO: Screenshots
